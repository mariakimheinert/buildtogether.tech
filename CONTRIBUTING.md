## Making Decisions

This project uses [Martha's Rules][marthas-rules] <cite>Minahan1986</cite> for consensus decision making:

1.  Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal by filing an
    issue in the GitHub repository tagged "proposal".  Proposals must be filed
    at least 24 hours before a meeting in order to be considered at that
    meeting, and must include:
    -   a one-line summary (the subject line of the issue)
    -   the full text of the proposal
    -   any required background information
    -   pros and cons
    -   possible alternatives

2.  A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are
    present.

3.  Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it.  The
    group may not discuss or vote on the issue unless the sponsor or their
    delegate is present.  The sponsor is also responsible for presenting the
    item to the group.

4.  After the sponsor presents the proposal, a "sense" vote is cast for the
    proposal prior to any discussion:
    -   Who likes the proposal?
    -   Who can live with the proposal?
    -   Who is uncomfortable with the proposal?

5.  If all of the group likes or can live with the proposal, it passes
    immediately.

6.  If most of the group is uncomfortable with the proposal, it is postponed for
    further rework by the sponsor.

7.  Otherwise, members who are uncomfortable can briefly state their objections.
    A timer is then set for a brief discussion moderated by the facilitator.
    After 10 minutes or when no one has anything further to add (whichever comes
    first), the facilitator calls for a yes-or-no vote on the question: "Should
    we implement this decision over the stated objections?"  If a majority votes
    "yes" the proposal is implemented.  Otherwise, the proposal is returned to
    the sponsor for further work.

## Formatting

1.  The commands to rebuild the site, run a server, produce the PDF version, and
    check internal consistency are stored in `Makefile` and use the tools in
    `bin/`. Run `make` on its own to get a list of available actions.

1.  Each chapter or appendix is identified by a slug such as `some-topic`.  Its
    text lives in <code><em>slug</em>/index.md</code>, and there is an entry
    under the `chapters` key in `_config.yml` with its slug and its title. This
    list controls ordering.

1.  Use only level-2 headings within chapters and appendices and use "Title
    Case" the titles.

1.  To create cross-references:
    -   Use `{% raw %}<span g="key">some text</span>{% endraw %}` for glossary
        entries. The key must appear in `_data/glossary.yml`.
    -   Use `{% raw %}<span x="slug"/>{% endraw %}` to cross-reference a chapter or
        appendix. The slugs must appear in `_config.yml`.
    -   Use `{% raw %}<span f="key"/>{% endraw %}` to cross-reference a figure
        and `{% raw %}<span t="key"/>{% endraw %}` to cross-reference a table.
    -    Use `{% raw %}<cite>key,key</cite>{% endraw %}` for bibliography
        citations.  The keys must appear in `bibliography/index.md`.

1.  Use `{% raw %}<span i="term">text</span>{% endraw %}` to add an index entry.
    This can be combined with a glossary reference, as in
    `{% raw %}<span i="term" g="key">text</span>{% endraw %}`.

1.  To include a code sample use
    `{% raw %}{% include code file="name.ext" %}{% endraw %}`.
    The path to the file must be relative to the including file.
    In most cases it will be in the same directory as the chapter or appendix.

1.  To continue a paragraph that has been interrupted by a code sample or
    something else, use:

    ```
    {: .continue}
    text of paragraph
    ```

    This has no effect on the appearance of the HTML, but prevents an unwanted
    paragraph indent in the PDF version.

1.  To create a callout box, use:

    ```
    <div class="callout" markdown="1">

    ### Title of callout

    text of callout

    </div>
    ```

    Use "Sentence case" for the callout's title, and please put blank lines
    before and after the opening and closing `<div>` markers.

1.  To insert an external link, use `{% raw %}[text][tag]{% endraw %}` in the
    body, then add the link to the Kramdown `link_defs` section in
    `_config.yml`.  The clumsy syntax is necessary to get around [this
    bug][jekyll-bug].

1.  To create a figure, put the image file in the same directory as the chapter
    or appendix and use this to include it:

    ```
    {% raw %}{% include figure id="label" img="file.svg"
                      alt="short text" cap="full caption" %}{% endraw %}
    ```

    where `label` is <code><em>chapter-slug</em>-<em>image-slug</em></code>,
    `alt` is just a few words long (plain text), and `cap` is the full caption
    that will appear inline (Markdown).

1.  Use [diagrams.net][diagrams] to create SVG diagrams.  Avoid screenshots when
    possible, since getting them to display correctly in print is a pain.

Note: you will need Python and LaTeX in order to build the PDF version of this book.
After installing them, you will need the packages listed in `requirements/python.txt`
and `requirements/latex.txt`.
